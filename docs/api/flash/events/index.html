<em> objects, which are passed as parameters to event listeners when an event
</em> occurs.
<em>
</em> <p>The properties of the Event class carry basic information about an
<em> event, such as the event's type or whether the event's default behavior can
</em> be canceled. For many events, such as the events represented by the Event
<em> class constants, this basic information is sufficient. Other events,
</em> however, may require more detailed information. Events associated with a
<em> mouse click, for example, need to include additional information about the
</em> location of the click event and whether any keys were pressed during the
<em> click event. You can pass such additional information to event listeners by
</em> extending the Event class, which is what the MouseEvent class does.
<em> ActionScript 3.0 API defines several Event subclasses for common events
</em> that require additional information. Events associated with each of the
<em> Event subclasses are described in the documentation for each class.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/haxeui/docs/api/flash/events/EventDispatcher.html">EventDispatcher</a></td><td><p>The EventDispatcher class is the base class for all classes that dispatch
<em> events. The EventDispatcher class implements the IEventDispatcher interface
</em> and is the base class for the DisplayObject class. The EventDispatcher
<em> class allows any object on the display list to be an event target and as
</em> such, to use the methods of the IEventDispatcher interface.
<em>
</em> <p>Event targets are an important part of the Flash<sup>®</sup> Player and
<em> Adobe<sup>®</sup> AIR<sup>®</sup> event model. The event target serves as
</em> the focal point for how events flow through the display list hierarchy.
<em> When an event such as a mouse click or a keypress occurs, Flash Player or
</em> the AIR application dispatches an event object into the event flow from the
<em> root of the display list. The event object then makes its way through the
</em> display list until it reaches the event target, at which point it begins
<em> its return trip through the display list. This round-trip journey to the
</em> event target is conceptually divided into three phases: the capture phase
<em> comprises the journey from the root to the last node before the event
</em> target's node, the target phase comprises only the event target node, and
<em> the bubbling phase comprises any subsequent nodes encountered on the return
</em> trip to the root of the display list.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/haxeui/docs/api/flash/events/EventPhase.html">EventPhase</a></td><td><p>The EventPhase class provides values for the <code>eventPhase</code>

<em> occur. A mouse event is usually generated by a user input device, such as a
</em> mouse or a trackball, that uses a pointer.
<em>
</em> <p>When nested nodes are involved, mouse events target the deepest possible
<em> nested node that is visible in the display list. This node is called the
</em> <i>target node</i>. To have a target node's ancestor receive notification
<em> of a mouse event, use <code>EventDispatcher.addEventListener()</code> on
</em> the ancestor node with the <code>type</code> parameter set to the specific
* mouse event you want to detect.</p></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><a href="/haxeui/docs/api/flash/events/TimerEvent.html">TimerEvent</a></td><td><p>A Timer object dispatches a TimerEvent objects whenever the Timer object
